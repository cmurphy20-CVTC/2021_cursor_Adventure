A skeleton project for our Java web app using Maven. 

Installation 
I created a java app and installed Maven so that it can be used online. Pivotal Tracker has been included to track our work. The project was uploaded to github and then heroku. The app is accessible using heroku. 


Beginning Plot:

The world has ended, all of the world’s superpowers have crumbled and there’s little humanity remaining.  This occurred in the year 2099.  A viral disease wiped out a great amount of people and amidst the pandemic people that maintained many nuclear silos left them unattended to.  This resulted in their instability and eventual destruction resulting in the world you will find out today.
Before this all happened your great grandparents warned you this very well could happen.  They lived through something similar over 50 years ago.  Somehow they knew something like this would happen again.  Taking their insight you had a bomb shelter made and stocked full of supplies in case this happened.  On the fateful day of November 26th 2099 all of the unattended nuclear bombs went off all over the planet and ravaged the countries.
Luckily for you, you stayed in your bomb shelter all alone since you expected something like this might happen when the pandemic started.  It’s been 3 months since then and you’re low on food and water.  You have 2 bottles of water, and 2 rations of food remaining.  It’s time for you to reemerge into the ravaged world to seek out food and water.

Tutorial:


Welcome to Cursor Adventure.  This is a post apocalyptic text based adventure game.  Your goal is to find food, water, protection, and eventually new shelter.  The world is open for you to explore and interact with.  Be sure to try all of your ideas since it could be life or death for you out in the wasteland.

Interacting:

LOOK

There’s many ways you can interact with the world.  Looking is one of the main fundamentals in text based adventure games.  Every room, item and object in each room has descriptions when you look at them.  You can say “LOOK ROOM” and you’ll get a reprompt for the current room you’re in.


LOOK OBJECT/ITEM

Every item in your inventory and most background items in room descriptions will have some description or flavor text about them.  Just type “LOOK  ____” followed by the object or item and you’ll get something back as to what they are.  Some objects have nothing of value to assess from them, so they’ll usually just be nothing interesting here.


MOVE/GO

Moving is another core fundamental of text based adventure games.  You need to be able to move or go somewhere to progress.  Typically rooms will be laid out and described in a way in which it’s easy to understand the directions you’re able to go in.  In this game you can specify a direction to go by saying either “GO RIGHT” or “GO EAST”.  Everytime a new room is loaded in it will describe the room even if you’ve been there before.


TAKE

Some items in the world and rooms will have some items that can be taken.  These will be added to your inventory and kept on you till use.  You can also use the command “INVENTORY” or “ITEMS” to check what you’ve picked up.  If you try to take items that cannot be picked up, you’ll get some text back as to why or what is stopping you.
