        I used to work at this police station keeping track of inventory. It's wasn't a glamous job but updating spreadsheets paid my bills.<br><br>
        Looks like people have already ransaked this place. Even if the armoury was raided some of the weapons were in password protected lockers.<br><br>
        Good thing I copied the codes and kept them in a fireproof safe. Wish I could have grabbed it before the bombs fell...and a real knife.<br><br>
        Luckily, theres one by this skeleton. I should pick it up. <br><br>
